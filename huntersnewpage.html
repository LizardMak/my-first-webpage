  <h1>About Hunter</h1>
  <p>I was born in 2002 in Santa Barbara, CA. <br>
    </br> Shortly after being born my family would leave California and move to where I now call home in Montana. <br>
    </br> I graduated from WHS in 2021 and have exclusively worked in restaurants since graduation, though with my recent enrollment in Epicodus in 2023 I hope to change that in the coming years. <br>
    </br> I currently have a family consisting of my mom and dad who run a Jeep rental company out of their house, 2 silly little dogs that love to fight each other, and a brother who is also in Epicodus. <br>
    </br> My main hobbies over the years have been driving, geopolitics, and video games, with coding soon to be added among them. <br>
    </br> That is essentially everything there is to know about me, <strong>EXCEPT FOR ONE VERY IMPORTANT THING</strong>
